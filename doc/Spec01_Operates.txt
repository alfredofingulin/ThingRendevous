/** \page Spec01_Operates Spec01: Operates Like Other Real-time Multitasking Priority-based Kernels

And that is:

\li the task is the basic unit of execution
\li tasks communicate using streams, messages, or events
\li tasks effect communication thru the kernel
\li the kernel gets an excuse to re-schedule tasks
\li the highest priority task wins and executes
\li the kernel handles pre-emption and context switching, and passing-along streams, messages, or events.
