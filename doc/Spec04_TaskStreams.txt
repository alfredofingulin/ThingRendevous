/** \page Spec04_TaskStreams Spec04: Tasks And Streams

A Tr task can:

\li read from it's own input stream; it cannot read from another task's stream
\li write to another task's input stream; the target task ID specifies the target task's stream.

\section Spec04_StreamCreation Task Steam Characteristics

A task can have a stream or not.
When the task is elaborated, the steam can be:

\li zero; the task has no stream
\li non-zero value 8, 16,..0xFFF0 bytes; the task's steam length; it must be multiple of 8 bytes.

And it is a stream:
data origin is not indicated in the stream.

\section Spec04_StreamsRBytes Streams Are Just Bytes, FIFO

'Nuff said.

\section Spec04_Operations Task Stream Operations

Read:

\li reads from the task's own stream
\li can specify a minimum and maximum number of bytes to read
\li if nothing is available, the task will be blocked until something becomes available and any other ready-to-run task will run.

Get is just like read, but:

\li if nothing is available, the task will regain control 
\li it will not be blocked and any other higher priority task will not be run.

Write:

\li writes to a target task's stream
\li can specify a minimum and maximum number of bytes to write
\li if another task of higher priority is ready to run, then the writing task may be blocked.

Put is just like write, but:

\li the writing task will regain control; 
\li it will not be blocked and any other higher priority task will not be run.
