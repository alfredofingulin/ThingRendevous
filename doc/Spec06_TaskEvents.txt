/** \page Spec06_TaskEvents Spec06: Tasks And Events

A Tr task can:

\li pend for events from it's own event queue; it cannot get events from another task's event queue
\li post events to another task's event queue; the target task ID specifies the target task's event queue.

\section Spec06_EventCreation Task Event Queue Characteristics

A task can have a event queue or not.
When the task is elaborated, the event queue can have:

\li zero entries; the task has no events
\li non-zero quantity of entries 1..1024; the quantity of events in the queue

Further: 

\li the event payload is always 32 bits.
\li queue ordering is always by priority of the sending task.

Whenever an event is dequeued, the originator task ID is presented.

\section Spec06_Operations Task Event Operations

Pend extracts an event from the task's own event queue.
If nothing is available, the task will be blocked until something becomes available and any other ready-to-run task will run.

Grab is just like pend, but:

\li if nothing is available, the task will regain control
\li it will not be blocked and any other higher priority task will not be run.

Post enqueues an event to a target task's event queue.
If another task of higher priority is ready to run, then the sending task may be blocked.

Stuff is just like post, but:
it will not be blocked and any other higher priority task will not be run.
