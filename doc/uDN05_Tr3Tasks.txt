/** \page uDN05_Tr3Tasks DesNote05: Instances/Tasks/Contexts

Tr knows about three kinds:

\li Tr Itself - ThingRendevous doing it's thing
\li Explicit Interrupt - The interrupt task using a Tr copy.
\li User - a presently running task this is not tr itself task and not an explicit-interrupt task

Each:

\li instance is a task
\li task runs on it's own stack.
\li context, the machine state of a task, is saved-to/restored-from the task stack.
