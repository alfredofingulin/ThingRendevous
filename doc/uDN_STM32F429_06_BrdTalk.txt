/** \page uDN_STM32F429_06_BrdTalk DesNote/STM32F429 06: Board & Linux Box Communication

The Nucleo board looks like a USB device.
There's a "disk" you can drag-n-drop to load code.
There's a "virtual terminal" you can use for debugging.

Here are some Ubuntu Linux things to know.

\section uDN_STM32F429_06_UpdateStLink Updating StLink Explains It Better Than This Note

Comm between your Linux box and the Nucleo board uses ARM's StLink software.

Head to the ARM website, get the StLink updater and update your board's comm software.

The process of doing that update is a simple education; your board probably needs it anyway.
Repeating all that info here adds nothing.

\section uDN_STM32F429_06_USBDevicesCreated USB Devices Created

Plugging-in the Nucleo board creates the following USB devices:

\li /dev/sdb : a mass storage device
\li /dev/serial : part of the CDC enumeration for the USB device on the board
\li /dev/sg2 : a generic SCSI mass storage controller emulator
\li /dev/ttyACM0 : a good old modem interface, but really a terminal and pass thru to the board's serial channel

\section uDN_STM32F429_06_DialoutGroupUpdate  For /dev/ttyACM0, Add Users To The Distro's Dialout Group

Use /dev/ttyACM0 for terminal IO (you always need a terminal).
But first, Ubuntu must be appeased.  Here's how.

~~ 1.  Note which users will need terminal access.

~~ 2.  Login as you system's admin/superuser.

~~ 3.  Use the following at the command line:

\code
/*
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
*/
\endcode

Kind of dangerous, 
as $USER can inflict a terminal on everything in the dialout group,
but so be it.

\section uDN_STM32F429_06_GtkTerm I Used GTK Term For A Terminal Emulator

is simple and it works.
