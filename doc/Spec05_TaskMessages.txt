/** \page Spec05_TaskMessages Spec05: Tasks And Messages

A Tr task can:

\li receive fixed length messages from it's own message queue; it cannot receive messages from another task's message queue
\li send fixed length messages to another task's message queue; the target task ID specifies the target task's message queue
\li order messages by priority or FIFO.

\section Spec05_MessageCreation Task Message Queue Characteristics

A task can have a message queue or not.
When the task is elaborated, the message queue can have:

\li zero entries; the task has no messages
\li non-zero quantity of entries 1..1024; the number of messages in the queue
\li message payload length of 8, 16, 24, or 32 bytes
\li queue ordering of either sending task ID priority or FIFO.

Whenever a message is dequeued, the message's originator task ID is also presented.

\section Spec05_Operations Task Message Operations

Receive extracts a message from the task's own message queue.
If nothing is available, the task will be blocked until something becomes available and any other ready-to-run task will run.

Take is just like receive, but:

\li if nothing is available, the task will regain control; 
\li it will not be blocked and any other higher priority task will not be run.

Send enqueues a message to a target task's message queue.
If another task of higher priority is ready to run, then the sending task may be blocked.

Give is just like send, but:
it will not be blocked and any other higher priority task will not be run.
