/** \page TN01_DelEnvToolsStyle TechNote01: Deliverables, Environment, Tools, Conventions, and Style

ThingRendevous:

\li is a software configuration item
\li and your app is a software configuration item too
\li tho both Tr and your app are linked together, both are separate and developed separately
\li is developed in a Linux environ
\li uses the GNU and Eclipse toolchain
\li tries to follow the  usual Linux style.

\section TN01_SourceIsDeliverable A Deliverable ThingRendevous Consists Of Source And Docs

These are the usual *.c/.h and *.txt files.
You compile and build the source, .c/.h, for your use.
The .txt files contain supporting documentation.

Doxygen is applied to source and documentation to create a browse-able doc package
(you're reading it now).
Learn more: tap Doxygen link at the lower right corner of this page.

See \link uDN00_DirStrucChart \endlink for partitioning and file locations.

\section TN01_EnvironUbuntu The Environment is Linux; The Distro is Ubuntu

Just about any Linux distro or equivalent Windows environ should work.

\section TN01_ToolSets Tr Is Tool-Agnostic; Eclipse Is Used; So Is The Command Line

Tr doesn't care about toolchains.  
These tech notes include
instructions for Eclipse; 
there's also some command line tools.
Whatever works.

\section TN01_CodingStyle Linux Coding Style and Conventions Observed, Mostly

In general, the 
\htmlonly <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle">Linux coding style</a> \endhtmlonly 
is observed.  Further:

\li Mixed case is used, with underscores where I feel like it
\li C99 types are used, as defined in stdint.h
\li initialized variables are not used; Tr uses initialization functions (aka something-like-a-constructor) at start-up rather than rely on pre-main() start-up initialization
\li types are appended with _t (not always, 'cause some doctrine states _t is reserved for Linux kernel items), 
structs with _s, defines with _something (usually with a lowercase word that classifies the constant), 
and pointers with _p.
\li enums are always assigned a value; enums are often used as indexes into arrays, like Ada.

Tr uses 
\htmlonly <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/indent/manual/indent.html">indent with your own command switches</a> \endhtmlonly
with the command line options: 

\li -linux; for usual Linux stuff, but
\li -l120; 120 character lines
\li -i4; four-space indent (not eight!)
\li -nut; spaces instead of tabs.
