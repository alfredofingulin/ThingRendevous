/** \page TN03_Eclipse TechNote03: Eclipse (32-bit): Set-up And Use

Here's how the 
\htmlonly <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> \endhtmlonly 
development environ is set-up and used with ThinkRendevous.

\section TN03_YouNeedJavaJDK You Need Java JDK 1.8

And that means OpenJDK, not JRE.

Either

~~ ensure /usr/lib/jvm is up-to-date

or

~~ install Java JDK into /usr/local/java using \htmlonly <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Install-Oracle-Java-JDK-on-Ubuntu-Linux">these instructions.</a> \endhtmlonly  You'll need to sudo.

and alternatively

~~ consider \htmlonly <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14788345/how-to-install-jdk-on-ubuntu-linux">these instructions.</a> \endhtmlonly  Need to sudo here too.

\section TN03_WhichOne Which Eclipse Package Is Used?

We've used Eclipse package Oxygen 1A for C/C++.

\section TN03_InstallingEclipse Installing Eclipse

~~ 1.  Download the Eclipse package .tar.gz file.

~~ 2.  Be root or sudo.

~~ 3.  Copy the .tar.gz file to /usr/local.

~~ 4.  Use "tar xfz filename.tar.gz" to extract everything.  
It'll go into /usr/local/eclipse.

~~ 5.  Make sure root owns all the files and directories.  Chown if necessary.

~~ 6.  In /usr/bin, make a symbolic link to /usr/local/eclipse/eclipse.

~~ 7.  Logout as root; login as a mere user.

~~ 8.  Open a terminal, type "eclipse" and it should happen.

\section TN03_WhatAmIGettingInto How About A Preview?

Since Tr is intended for embedded systems,
and Linux is hosting a cross-development platform,
it makes sense to use something configured for cross development.
