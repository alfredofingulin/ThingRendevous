/** \page uDN_ACM4_01_Things2Get DesNote/ARM Cortex M4 01: Things To Get

Here are documents and source code to have handy.

Tr uses source code from the three sources, Freescale, ARM, ARM GCC;
modifies some of it; and includes modified versions in this subdirectory.

Have the docs for reference; Tr design notes expand on this info.

\section uDN_ACM4_01_ARMAppNotes ARM's App Notes For The Cortex M4

Go to \htmlonly <a href="http://www.arm.com/">ARM's website</a> \endhtmlonly
and get Application Note 179, Cortex-M3 Embedded Software Development;
it's also relevant to M4 development.
This note covers exception handling and some context switching issues;
that's important to the rendezvous tasks.

Get Application Note 298 on Cortex M4 Lazy Stacking and Context Switching;
also important to the rendezvous tasks.

Visit \htmlonly <a href="http://mcuoneclipse.com/2013/07/21/diy-free-toolchain-for-kinetis-part-1-gnu-arm-build-tools/">The DIY Free Toolchain for Kinetis.</a> \endhtmlonly
This fine man's notes started about the same time as mine; lots of good info here.

\section uDN_ACM4_01_ARMCMSIS ARM's CMSIS Spec And Code For The Cortex M4

Get
\htmlonly <a href="http://www.arm.com/cmsis">ARM's CMSIS spec</a> \endhtmlonly
too:

\li register definition headers 
\li start-up code files
\li standard practices 

for ARM Cortex M4 development.

These are included in a uP-specific ext subdirectory.
