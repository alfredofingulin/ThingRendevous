/** \page Spec07_TaskControl Spec07: Task Control

A Tr task can control itself or other tasks only by
making itself or another task wait.
Waiting "now" or "forever" is an option (think about it).

\section Spec07_Itself Controlling Itself

A task can make itself wait:

\li zero-time; the task relinquishes control temporarily to any other task ready-to-run
\li non-zero-time; the task relinquishes control for a minimum amount of time to any other task ready-to-run
\li max-time; the task suspends itself until told to wait zero- or non-zero by another task.

\section Spec07_OtherTasks Controlling Other Tasks

A task can make another task wait:

\li zero-time; if the target task is waiting then the wait is canceled and the task made ready-to-run
\li non-zero-time; the target task is forced to wait a minimum amount of time
\li max-time; the target task is suspended until told to wait zero- or non-zero by another task.

\section Spec07_TaskTime Task Time

The wait duration is in system clock ticks, as an unsigned 16-bit value.

\li 0: relinquish or make ready
\li 1..0xFFFE: the wait time in ticks
\li 0xFFFF: wait indefinately.

Told you you'd get it if you thought about it.
