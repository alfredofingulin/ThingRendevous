Some not obvious knowledge gained while writing the context switcher.

\section uDN_ACM4_03_TskCrExEmul During context creation, while setting up registers on the stack to emulate an exception...

~~ The xPSR register:

\li must have bit 25 set; it says we're in Thumb mode to stay.
Read and mask doesn't work 'cause it's read as zero.
Set it by hand.
\li clear the IT bits; dirty ones nail you to the Tree of Woe.

~~ Any C-function-pointer/ThingRendevous-task-entry-address 
must have bit 0 cleared, and then put on the context/stacked-PC.

Context/exeception returns demand this.

In GNU/ARM/C-land, any function pointer is returned with bit 0 set.
That works for branch-link-xchange, but not for execption returns.

~~ Stacked-LR can leave bit 0 set.
