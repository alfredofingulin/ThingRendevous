/** \page Spec09_SysClkTick Spec09: System Clock Ticks

Tr needs a system clock tick.

Tr just counts ticks.  It doesn't care about duration.
Time-of-day and date are not kept by Tr (but one of your tasks can).

Tick periodicity, granularity, and accuracy is up to you.

Tr's system clock tick interface is called by your application
on every tick.

Tr's clock is a counter:

\li used exclusively for time-ing out system calls
\li initialized to zero at start-up
\li incremented as often as called.

That's it.
