/** \page Spec02_IDPriorities Spec02: IDs and Priorities

Tr identifies each task and the task's communication mechanism
using a unique ID number.
Tasks also have a priority.

Here are the conventions.

\section Spec02_IDRules ID Rules

\li Each task ID is unique.
\li Duplicate IDs are not allowed.
\li The ID refers not only to the task, but any stream, message buffer, or event queue possessed by the task.

\section Spec02_IDAllocValues ID Values And Allocations

IDs are unsigned 16-bits and range 0..0xFFFF; but many values are reserved.

/*
  ID Value  |  Usage
------------+-----------------------------------------------------
0           | o Not used by anyone.
            | o Indicates "self" ie my task ID.
            |
1..62       | o Reserved by Tr for future use.
            |
63          | o Not used by anyone.
            | o Indicates a broadcast to all tasks having ID 1..62.
            |
64          | o Tr's explicit interrupt task.
            | o This task never receives broadcasts.
            | o It does not have events, messages, or streams.
            |
65..126     | o Reserved by Tr for future use.
            |
127         | o Not used by anyone.
            | o Indicates a broadcast to all tasks having ID 65..126.
            |
128         | o Tr itself.
            | o This task never receives broadcasts.
            | o It does not have events, messages, or streams.
            |
129..190    | o Reserved by Tr for future use.
            |
191         | o Not used by anyone.
            | o Indicates a broadcast to all tasks having ID 129..190.
            |
192         | o Tr's clock tick task.
            | o This task never receives broadcasts.
            | o It does not have events, messages, or streams.
            |
193...254   | o Reserved by Tr for future use.
            |
255         | o The application's initialization task.
            | o This task never receives broadcasts.
            | o It does not have events, messages, or streams.
            |
0x0100..    |
   0xFFFE   | o Available to application tasks.
            |
0xFFFF      | o Not used by anyone.
            | o Indicates "empty" or "unused".

\section Spec02_PriorityRules Priority Rules

\li Priority values are inverse: The larger the value, the lower the priority.
\li Tasks with IDs 1..255 are forced to corresponding priority value 1..255.
\li Tasks with IDs 0x0100..0xFFFE can be any value 0x0100..0xFFFE
\li Tasks with IDs 0x0100..0xFFFE can duplicate priorities; ie two tasks may have the same priority value
\li The task priority refers not only to the task, but any stream, message buffer, or event queue possessed by the task.

\section Spec02_PriorityAllocValues Priority Values And Allocations

IDs are unsigned 16-bits and range 0..0xFFFF; but many values are reserved.

\li Priority value 0 means "self" or "the default priority"
\li Priority value 0xFFFF means "empty" or "unused".
