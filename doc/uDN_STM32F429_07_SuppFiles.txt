/** \page uDN_STM32F429_SuppFiles DesNote/STM32F429 07: Support Files

There's a variety of support files.

\section uDN_STM32F429_HandyStuff ext/STM32F429Nucleo144/HandyStuff

Two files are there to help you test your board interface set-up.
Both are binaries, created using ARM's mBed online compiler tools.
Drag-n-drop these to your board when connected via USB.

\li Nucleo_blink_led_NUCLEO_F429ZI.bin - just blinks an LED
\li Nucleo_printf_NUCLEO_F429ZI.bin - dumps to the virtual terminal

\section uDN_STM32F429_Goodies_copies ext/STM32F429Nucleo144/Goodies/*.c/h but not F429_*

These are copies from the ext/STM32F429Nucleo144/Drivers path,
configured for this board.

\li These initialize and perform IO for various parts of the board.
\li These do not require Tr to operate.

Modify these to build a unique configuration.

\section uDN_STM32F429_Goodies_uniqs ext/STM32F429Nucleo144/Goodies/F429_*.c/h

F429_*.c/h are unique support files for the board created for this distribution.

\li These initialize and perform IO for various parts of the board.
\li These do not require Tr to operate.

\section uDN_STM32F429_trDrivers ext/STM32F429Nucleo144/trDrivers

trF429_*.c/h are Tr-based support files for the board.

\li These utilize Tr API calls to operate.
\li These can override HAL functions to make changes to operation.
