/** \page uDN01_InitEverywhere DesNote01: someModule_init Is Everywhere

Tr does not make any run-time initialization assumptions.
It does not depend on initialized data; it wants certainty.

To do that, trAPI_Start() runs every module's initialization function.

Every module contains a function of the form

\code
void someModule_init( void )
{
    // whatever it takes
}
\endcode

whose job is just that.

It's a constructor.
