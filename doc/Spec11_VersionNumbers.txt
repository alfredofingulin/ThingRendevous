/** \page Spec11_VersionNumbers Spec11: Version Numbering

Tr uses the form:

\code
/*
Major.Minor.BuildFix[-rcX]
*/
\endcode

where:

\li Major indicates a milestone or change in behavior and/or internal design.
\li Minor indicates support additions (new micros and so on), refinement, or refactoring.
\li BuildFix indicates indicates a new build or bug fix.
\li optional -rcX, where -rc is "release candidate" and X is a sequentially increasing number.  Major.Minor.BuildFix reflects the baseline used for -rcX.

The date is usually included, but is not necessary.  Dates are always
of the form:

\code
/*
DayOfTheWeek [period of the day], DD Month Year
*/
\endcode

all of which are fully spelled-out.

We try to use the metric system.

It's helpful to know another language other than one's mother-tongue.

Bullet and cartridge are two different things.
Calibers are whatever the originator desired, English or metric.
Ditto for cartridge dimensions.  
Powder charges are still grains, tho.

Magazines and clips are two different things;
confusing the two annoys me to no end.

Let folks know if the meat is pork.  
Don't use suet when preparing vegatarian dishes.  
Always order at least one all-veggie pizza.

Divide by zero is undefined; it's not really infinity.
