/** \page uDN_STM32F429_01_Things2Get DesNote/STM32F4xx 01: Things To Get

You'll need the 
\htmlonly <a href="http://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stm32cubef4.html">STM32CubeF4 firmware package (get it here)</a> \endhtmlonly
and nearly every ST Micro app note you can get for the STM32F429.

A .zip file, en.stm32cubefw.zip, 

\li contains 1.14.0 firmware as received from ST Micro
\li is included without modification in this distribution
\li was used to develop and test ThingRendevous on the board
\li there's surely a later version at the website above.

The hardware configurator is also included in en.stm32cubemx.zip.

The app notes are not included, but here's a filename to app note xref:
