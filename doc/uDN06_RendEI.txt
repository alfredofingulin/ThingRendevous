/** \page uDN06_RendEI DesNote06: Rendezvous With Explicit Interrupts

The explicit interrupt rendezvous enters on:

\li an explicit interrupt
\li the first entry, switches to an explicit interrupt stack
\li nested entries, does nothing special; it's already an explicit interrupt.

The usual Tr API requests are allowed.
An explicit interrupt is a copy of Tr running on an explicit interrupt stack.

The explicit interrupt rendezvous leaves on:

\li nested leaves, does nothing special; it's already an explicit interrupt.
\li the last leave, may reschedule and switch to a new task
\li leave to the explicit interrupt or another task.

Tr itself task is another task running on another stack.
Tr itself becomes an interruptable task, subject to the usual rules.

Both copies of tr must be aware of explicit interrupts.

To keep track of explicit interrupt nesting, use a light-weight counting semaphore.

============++=============
  > 1       ||  Already running as explicit interrupt.
            ||  Decrement nesting.

            ||  Back to the task.
            ||  Another task is running.
------------++-------------
  0         ||  An error.
