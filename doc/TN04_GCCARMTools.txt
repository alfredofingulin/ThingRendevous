/** \page TN04_GCCARMTools TechNote04: GCC ARM Tools: Set-up And Use

ARM maintains an  
\htmlonly <a href="https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded">embedded development tool set at launchpad.net</a> \endhtmlonly
It includes the usual tools, pre-built binaries, and Linux and Windows tools.

ARM's instructions are good; the following might help.

~~ 1.  Download the toolset package .bz2 file to /path/SomeWhere

~~ 2.  cd /usr/local ; install things there.

~~ 3.  Make yourself root or prepare to sudo.

~~ 4.  Use "tar xjf /path/SomeWhere/package.bz2" to extract everything.  
Everything will be put into /opt/package.

~~ 5.  Ensure root owns all the files and directories.  Chown if necessary.

~~ 6.  Use a fully qualified pathname to access the tools.

The toolset's readme file has useful suggestions too.
