/** \page uDN_STM32F429_03_FPFun DesNote/STM32F4xx 03: Floating Point Fun

As of this writing, Tr does not support floating point context switches.

But: the STM32F4xx series includes a floating point unit.

\li the FPU can be disabled, and all single or double precision calcuations done in software
\li float-s (single precision) are supported in hardware
\li double-s (double precision) are emulated in software

You may want to change GCC switches:

\li Emulated float, -mfloat-abi=soft
\li Hardware FPU, -mfloat-abi=softfp
\li there's another but I don't recommend it.

Reading the 
\htmlonly <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/ARM-Options.html">GCC command line switches for ARM</a> \endhtmlonly
is strongly recommended.

ST App Note 044, /Floating point unit demonstration on STM32 microcontrollers/,
is highly recommended.
