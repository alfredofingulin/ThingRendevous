/** \page uDN_STM32F429_02_Where2Start DesNote/STM32F4xx 02: Where To Start

Unzip the en.stm32fcubefw.zip into ext/STM32F429Nucleo144.

\li Under ext/STM32F429Nucleo144, unpack only Drivers and Middlewares
\li Leave the subdirectory structure intact
\li A subsequent design note describes how we'll use Drivers and Middlewares
\li You may unpack Projects/STM32429ZI-Nucleo elsewhere; we won't use it, but it'll be a good reference.

Read en.stm32fcubefw.zip's file Release_Notes.html.

The continue with 
Documention/STM32429ZI-Nucleo/STM32CubeF4GettingStarted.pdf
and head to the next design note.
