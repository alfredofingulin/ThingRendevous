/** \page uDN_ACM4TR_03_8BytStkAlign DesNote/ARM Cortex M4 and Tr 03: 8-Byte Stack Alignment

In ARM Cortex M4, stacks must be aligned on 8-byte boundaries.
(Well, strictly speaking, no; but these should be.)

To do this, and avoid compiler \_\_attribute\_\_ majic/dependancies,
do this:

\code
#define SomeTask_Stack_len 1024 // in bytes
uint64_t SomeTask_Stack[ ( SomeTask_Stack_len / 8 ) ];

// and use...

(uint8_t *) &SomeTask_Stack[0];  // ...to pass the stack location
\endcode

The only reason this isn't a general ThingRendevous rule is
because some processors don't do 64-bit ints too well.
