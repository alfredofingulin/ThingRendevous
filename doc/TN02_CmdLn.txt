/** \page TN02_CmdLn TechNote02: Building A Tr Library Config, Tr App, and Docs

Using the command line?  Here are things to remember.

\section TN02_IncBldPth Building Tr: Include Paths

When building Tr, make sure these paths are used for include files:

\li tr/inc
\li tr/src

Any ARM Cortex M4 CPU-specifics are written in assembler.

\section TN02_StLib Create a Static .a Archive

Create a static library, a .a archive file, of all compiled object modules.
That'll be linked to your application.

\section TN02_IncAppPth Building An App: Include Paths

When building an application (and not Tr), 
use these paths for include files:

\li tr/ext/SomeCPU ; whatever is specific to your CPU
\li tr/inc ; that's it, the app doesn't need anything else.

\section TN02_TrLib Building An App: Link To The Tr Static Archive

Remember to incorp this into your library list.

\section TN02_HowDox How To Build Browse-able Docs?

Get in Tr's root directory, use the command line,
and invoke "doxygen Doxyfile".
