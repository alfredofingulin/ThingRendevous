/** \mainpage What Is This? 

ThingRendevous, aka Tr, 
is a real-time multitasking priority-based scheduling kernel 
for embedded systems.

Please see README.md for an overview.

This is release 0.0.1 for Thursday afternoon, 14th June 2018.

It's passed initial tests, but needs a good shakedown cruise.
